A web interface to manage Linux-based networking and virtualization
appliances. It's been developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux and its 
derivative for embedded systems, Voyage Linux (http://linux.voyage.hk/). 
It should work on other distros too, altough untested right now. Feel free 
to contribute and test.

Software requirements for "core" (check individual directories under modules/
for module-specific, additional requirements): 

* ruby >= 2.0.0
* sudo
* iproute2
* iptables (with proper kernel support)
* bridge-utils (brctl)
* pciutils (lspci command)
* usbutils (lsusb command)
* dhcpcd 
  * Also, resolvconf is recommended
* dnsmasq >= 2.61, != 2.63
  * removed ISC-style leasefile format, which is assumed when no
    dhcp-range is provided -- and leads to troubles
  * --host-record (bugfree ;)
* locales 
  ## and generate (UTF8) locales for languages/countries you want to support
* ifrename (optional) 

Gems:

    gem install bundler

    bundle install

Please note there might still be module-specific dependencies, check
documentation of individual modules to troubleshoot.

Please read carefully doc/sysadm/example/etc/sysctl.conf and copy and/or append 
the configuration to the Linux machine /etc/sysctl.conf file.
