A web interface to manage Linux-based networking and virtualization
appliances. It's been developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux and its
derivative for embedded systems, Voyage Linux (http://linux.voyage.hk/).
It should work on other distros too, altough untested right now. Feel free
to contribute and test.

For any web page, you may change .html extension into .json to
get machine-readable data.

An .rb extension is also available for debugging purposes when in
Sinatra 'development' environment.

Software requirements for "core" (check individual directories under modules/
for module-specific, additional requirements):

* ruby >= 2.0.0
* sudo
* iproute2
* iptables (with proper kernel support)
* bridge-utils (brctl)
* pciutils (lspci command)
* usbutils (lsusb command)
* dhcpcd
  * Also, resolvconf is recommended
* dnsmasq >= 2.61, != 2.63
  * removed ISC-style leasefile format, which is assumed when no
    dhcp-range is provided -- and leads to troubles
  * --host-record (bugfree ;)
* locales
  ## and generate (UTF8) locales for languages/countries you want to support
* ifrename (optional)

Gems:

    gem install bundler

    bundle install

Please note there might still be module-specific dependencies, check
documentation of individual modules to troubleshoot.

--

Please read carefully doc/sysadm/example/etc/sysctl.conf and copy and/or append
the configuration to the Linux machine /etc/sysctl.conf file.

NEW: Automated provisioning

etc/scripts/platform/*/setup.sh

modules/radius-admin/etc/scripts/platform/*/setup.sh

And more modules to come.

For a local development environment you can use Vagrant (vagrantup.com).

    vagrant up

You can also start separately margay vm and client vm:

    vagrant up nargay
    vagrant up margay-client

The same other Vagrant commands: provision, halt, suspend, destroy etc.

If you install the vagrant-proxyconf plugin,
you also set proxy environment variables if you want to use a proxy
for downloading packages during provisioning etc.

See https://github.com/tmatilai/vagrant-proxyconf#environment-variables for more.
