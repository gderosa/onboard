== System requirements

=== QEMU

QEMU with KVM support (and kernel and hardware accordingly).

You should grant rw access on /dev/kvm to the OnBoard user!

OnBoard user needs read/WRITE access even on DVD/CDROM ISO images, if
you want to eject/replace them at runtime: maybe a bug in QEMU Monitor...

Copy [this directory]/doc/sysadm/examples/etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel-nested.conf
into your host's /etc/modprobe.d/ to enable Nested VMX. More info at
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/virtual/kvm/nested-vmx.txt

Now, USB disk/pendrive support is enabled. If you want to *boot* from
such a device:

  * you need a recent qemu-kvm release (and related/included BIOSes): 
    * fine: qemu-kvm-1.2.0 compiled from source;
    * bad:  qemu-kvm-1.0   from Ubuntu package;
  * you must use the boot menu (press F12) and choose the USB device; 
  * you might have to *wait* a bit, after bootloader screen (for example
    with a Debian installer image).


=== Other programs

'tunctl': on Debian, it's provided by uml-utilities package (currently
it's not actually used: TAPs are created on demand by qemu-kvm itself,
but may be useful nonethless).

attr: could be useful for distributed filesystems to store images: namely GlusterFS
(there are plans to integrate); see 
http://community.gluster.org/q/how-do-i-reuse-a-brick-after-deleting-the-volume-it-was-formerly-part-of/


== OnBoard module dependencies:

jqueyFileTree


== Gem dependencies:

gem install uuid rmagick cronedit chronic_duration


== VNC/SPICE clients and video performance

To avoid mouse pointer mismatches, a client with capture/release is
strongly suggested, such as Vinagre on Unix or [see below] on Windows.

Alternetively, you can use SPICE (by RedHat Inc.), which is a more 
advanced protocol. There are clients for Unix and Windows, with 
capture/release (they also support VNC):

http://spice-space.org/download.html .

By default, guests get a QXL paravirtual Video card: it's VGA and VESA 
compatible but if you install guest drivers (from the link above, for
example) you'll get optimal performance especially via SPICE.

Among other things, SPICE transports audio, while VNC does not.
