The directory structure of this module follows the same conventions
of the root dir, so you could *in principle* move all files there and make
its functionalities part of the core.

Anyway, this should not be a requirement for all modules: sometimes
a simpler file hierarcy might be considered more valuable than the bare
compliance to a "standard".

DEPENDENCIES:

This module depends on the module "easy-rsa".

GEMS:

gem install uuid rubyzip archive-tar-minitar --no-ri --no-rdoc
