This module just read/writes into the FreeRADIUS MySQL database. It's somewhat
inspired to the PHP project DaloRADIUS ( http://daloradius.com/ ). 
/etc/freeradius must be pre-configured to make this module work. Of course,
it may also manage a remote radius server.

DEPENDENCIES:
# gem install sequel mysql

MODULE DEPENDENCIES:
