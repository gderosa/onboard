This module just reads/writes into the FreeRADIUS MySQL database. It's somewhat
inspired to the PHP project DaloRADIUS ( http://daloradius.com/ ).
/etc/freeradius must be pre-configured to make this module work. Of course,
it may also manage data on a remote server.

DEPENDENCIES:

Distro packages (Debian - please find equivalent for your distribution):

  apt-get install freeradius freeradius-mysql

Gems:

  gem install sequel mysql

OnBoard modules:

* radius-admin
* mail
