On Voyage Linux and other distros optimized for embededd systems, the root
filesysem is mounted read-only. File that need write acces may be put
in a RAM filesystem, persistence may be achieved adding dirs to
VOYAGE_SYNC_DIRS in /etc/default/voyage-util .

Otherwise, you may have /var on a different, writable partition (maybe on
an additional hard disk). File in /etc that need to be writeable may be
turned into symlinks to, say, /var/etc/some/file.conf .
