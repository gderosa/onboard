This directory was originally intended to provide example config files (or templates) for manual deployment.

The path of this directory is still `doc/sysadm/examples` although it's now used by automated deployment scripts.

The directory path has been retained for compatibility reasons, thus avoiding potential disruption in existing scripts.
