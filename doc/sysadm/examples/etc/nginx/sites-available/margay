# In most cases, administrators will remove this file from sites-enabled/ and
# leave it as reference inside of sites-available where it will continue to be
# updated by the nginx packaging team.
#
# This file will automatically load configuration files provided by other
# applications, such as Drupal or Wordpress. These applications will be made
# available underneath a path with that package name, such as /drupal8.

# Default server configuration

	# listen 80 default_server;

	# SSL configuration

	listen 443 ssl default_server;
	listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;

	# Note: You should disable gzip for SSL traffic.

	# Self signed certs generated by the ssl-cert package
	# Don't use them in a production server!
	#
	# MARGAY note: a valid cert would require knowledge of what public FQDN
	# is in use (if any). Otherwise, if a OpenVPN + private IPs is used,
	# an HTTPS reverse proxy
	# should not be even necessary, as crypto is provided by OpenVPN.
	# So, it's hard to predict/automate this. We bring up this basic
	# not-super-secure setup so an admin can improve it (or, again, just tunnel everything
	# with OpenVPN and not use this at all).
