Providing DHCP an DNS services to the local network.

* REQUIRED VERSIONS: 2.61 or 2.62 or 2.64 and higher.
  * Need --host-record to work properly. See Dnsmasq CHANGELOG.

* Do not use BIND or other nameservers installed locally

* use dnsmasq for serving DHCP and forward DNS queries to external
  nameservers (not to localhost) got via dhcp (yes, this appliance may be
  a dhcp client on some interface and dhcp server on other) or setup
  manually

* at least on Debian systems you SHOULD (MUST?) install the 'resolvconf'
  package
  * for example, dhcpcd is wrapped and cannot update /etc/resolv.conf without
    calling resolvconf

* /etc/dnsmasq.conf must be empty (or not exist at all).
 * service will be restartet with --conf-dir=__a_custom_dir__ , but
   /etc/dnsmasq.conf will be read anyway, so we need to avoid
   conficts/duplicates

* If you compile Dnsmasq from sources you may need to change, in
  /etc/init.d/dnsmasq

DAEMON=/usr/sbin/dnsmasq

  to:

DAEMON=/usr/local/sbin/dnsmasq

  (this won't be necessary when dnsmasq.rb becomes distro-independent,
  one day... ;-)
